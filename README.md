Tiny10 comes with the bare minimum, and before you install it, you might want to read this guide 


# ok whats tiny10?
Tiny10 is a barebone version of windows 10 that removes all unnecessary apps and bloatware for more performance
its also known for having a significant performance change on older hardware

tiny10 contains
-File explorer
-Powershell

What you will need
------------------
- A pendrive (to put the executable files here, you could use a phone or another pc to do this, but hey, just incase)
-The apps that are in this list


# App list 1)Browser

Now browsers can be a nessesity depending on who you are, whether you want to surf the web or do something else idk

We have 2 options
- A chromium based browser like Google Chrome
- A non-chromium based browser like Brave

"ok and whats the difference between chromium based and non-chromium based?"
